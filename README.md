# Defeating DVWA

*"Damn Vulnerable Web App (DVWA) is a PHP/MySQL web application that is damn vulnerable. Its main goals are to be an aid for security professionals to test their skills and tools in a legal environment, help web developers better understand the processes of securing web applications and aid teachers/students to teach/learn web application security in a class room environment."*

DVWA is a learning tool that I have been enjoying very much. Regrettably, I
never gave it a proper going over. This little book will go over the different
sections that I complete. There is no guarantee that I've done it the best way, or even a good way. Frankly, I have no idea what I'm talking about most of the time.

It will contain spoilers, so if you want to figure out all the answers for yourself, turn away now.

## Tools
